    // There are some important differences between this many-to-many
    // relationship and the one-to-many relationship discussed earlier. The
    // first is a mathematical inevitability: when a many-to-many relationship
    // is bidirectional, both sides of the relationship are many-to-many
    // mappings.
    // The second difference is that there are no join columns on either side of
    // the relationship. You will see in the next section that the only way to
    // implement a many-to-many relationship is with a separate join table. The
    // consequence of not having any join columns in either of the entity tables
    // is that there is no way to determine which side is the owner of the
    // relationship. Because every bidirectional relationship has to have both
    // an owning side and an inverse side, we must pick one of the two entities
    // to be the owner. In this example, we picked Employee to be owner of the
    // relationship, but we could have just as easily picked Project instead. As
    // in every other bidirectional relationship, the inverse side must use the
    // mappedBy element to identify the owning attribute.
    // Note that no matter which side is designated as the owner, the other side
    // should include the mappedBy element; otherwise, the provider will think
    // that both sides are the owner and that the mappings are separate
    // unidirectional relationships.
